# Website
If you want to make a website, you can use the code that I will give to you.

# Code

<h1>Welcome to My Project!</h1>
<p>This is a paragraph of text using an HTML <b>bold</b> tag and <i>italic</i> tag.</p>

<div>
  <h2>Project Status</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Feature A: In progress</li>
    <li>Feature B: Planned</li>
  </ul>
</div>

<img src="via.placeholder.com" alt="Placeholder Image">

Here is an example of an HTML boilerplate code:



```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <title>My Website</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>Hello World!</h1>
    <p>This is my first webpage.</p>
</body>
</html>
```
### To Host an Actual Website

If you want to host a functional website with a full `index.html` file using your repository, you should use **

**.

*   Place your full `index.html` file in the root directory or a `docs/` folder of your repository.
*   Enable GitHub Pages in your repository's settings to serve that HTML file as a static website.
